# Nim2JSON
This tool converts Nim to an easy to parse JSON format!

## Why?
Because fuck you kind stranger!

Okay for real, this was made with the goal to make Nim truely portable to many other programming languages, current languages we wanna port this to (we will cross off languages that we've managed to make a transpiler(?) for):

 * Lua 5.1
   * 5.1 specifically because ComputerCraft (A minecraft mod) and a few other games use Lua 5.1 for scripting!

 * Python
   * This would be more of a low-priority goal to see how flexible it is

 * Java
   * Now this, THIS is the real beast, the goal of this would be to attempt to make a Java backend for Nim that intergrates decently with other Java libraries, and for using Nim to make a Java library itself.
     * This will definitely be harder than the others, but would be amazing to pull off!
